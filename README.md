# Cinema Room Manager

A Hyperskill project to create a simple cinema room manager. The program will help manage the seats in the cinema room.
It will display the seats, mark the seats that are already booked, and help a user buy tickets. The program will also
display statistics about the number of seats and the income from the tickets.
